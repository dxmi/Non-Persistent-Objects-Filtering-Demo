# XAF - How to filter and sort non-persistent objects


If a collection of [non\-persistent objects](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/116516/concepts/business-model-design/non-persistent-objects) contains many items, you may need to filter it. However, built-in filters are disabled for non-persistent collections by default.

> [!WARNING]
> We created this example for demonstration purposes and it is not intended to address all possible usage scenarios.
> If this example does not have certain functionality or you want to change its behavior, you can extend this example. This can be a complex task that requires good knowledge of XAF: [UI Customization Categories by Skill Level](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/application_framework/xaf-considerations-for-newcomers.xml#ui-customization-categories), and you may need to research how our components work. Refer to the following help topic for more information: [Debug DevExpress .NET Source Code with PDB Symbols](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/403656/support-debug-troubleshooting/debug-controls-with-debug-symbols).

## Implementation Details

To enable filtering and sorting for [non\-persistent objects](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/116516/concepts/business-model-design/non-persistent-objects), you can use either the built-in `DynamicCollection` class or a custom `DynamicCollectionBase` descendant.

1. Create a `DynamicCollection` instance and pass it in the [NonPersistentObjectSpace\.ObjectsGetting](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.ObjectsGetting) event handler.
2. Subscribe to the `DynamicCollection.FetchObjects` event and pass a new collection of non-persistent objects every time filter or sort parameters change.
3. If you cannot filter the collection, set the `ShapeData` event parameter to `true`. The `DynamicCollection` then processes the data (filter, sort, and trim) internally.
   
     When you use the `DynamicCollection`, the built-in [FullTextSearch action](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112997/concepts/filtering/full-text-search-action) is displayed in corresponding non-persistent list views.

4. The `FindArticlesController` in this example shows a custom search form with a lookup editor that allows filtering non-persistent objects in a lookup list view.

This example demonstrates two approaches to filter objects.

- **Contact** objects are filtered at the storage level. `Criteria` and `Sorting` values passed in event parameters are converted to a storage-specific format and used as arguments of the `DataTable.Select` method call. `DataSet` returns filtered and sorted data that is then transformed into non-persistent objects. This approach can be useful when data for non-persistent objects is obtained from a remote service, a custom database query or a stored procedure.

- **Article** objects are filtered and sorted internally by a `DynamicCollection`. This functionality is enabled when the `ShapeData` parameter of the `DynamicCollection.FetchObjects` event is set to `true`. This approach is useful when all data is already available and no custom processing is required.
